## Why MoniGo?

> Drop-in performance monitoring for any Go application — from REST APIs to background workers. Add **three lines of code** and get a live dashboard, Prometheus metrics, and OpenTelemetry export out of the box.

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Async Telemetry Pipeline" icon="rocket">
    Decoupled metric collection from processing ensures zero impact on application latency.
  </Card>
